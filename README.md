# Frontend Development Internship Project - Spring Practice

Welcome to the repository of my **Frontend Development Internship Project**, where I contributed as part of a Spring practice program. During this internship, I focused on developing the front-end of a web application using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that improves code quality and maintainability.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework used for designing responsive and modern UI components.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the complete project that I worked on during the internship. The project was focused on building out various front-end components and pages, and I contributed to key UI elements.

### My Contributions

I was responsible for developing the following components:

1. **Help and Contact Button**: 
   - A component used for customer support or inquiry purposes, with options to contact or request help.

2. **BlogCard Component**:
   - Displays brief overviews of blog posts, including title, description, and a call-to-action button.

3. **Input Component**:
   - A reusable input field component that is utilized across the website for various forms.

4. **Radio Group Component**:
   - A component used to select one option from a list, implemented in the registration process.

5. **Checkbox Component**:
   - Used to allow users to select multiple options, also incorporated in the registration process.

These components were integrated throughout different sections of the project, specifically focusing on the **Register** page and other key UI functionalities. My work focused on making sure that these components were fully responsive and user-friendly, while adhering to design principles and accessibility standards.

## How to Run the Project

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repo-name.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd repo-name
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The application will run locally at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Conclusion

This project was an invaluable learning experience, allowing me to apply and enhance my skills in **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. I enjoyed working on both the individual components and seeing how they fit into the larger structure of the project.
