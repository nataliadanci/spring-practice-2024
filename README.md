# Frontend Development Internship Project - Spring Practice

Welcome to the repository of my **Frontend Development Internship Project**, where I contributed as part of a Spring practice program. During this internship, I focused on developing the front-end of a web application using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the complete project I worked on during the internship, which focused on building various front-end components and pages. These components were eventually combined to create a mock-up interface of the About You website.

### My Contributions

I was responsible for developing the following components:

1. **Help and Contact Button**: 
   - A component used for customer support or inquiry purposes, with options to contact or request help.

2. **BlogCard Component**:
   - Displays brief overviews of blog posts, including title, description, and a call-to-action button.

3. **Carousel Component**:
   - A dynamic image or content slider, which enhances the visual aspect of the website by showcasing multiple items in a scrollable format. This was particularly useful for displaying featured content or images in a visually appealing manner.

4. **Input Component**:
   - A reusable input field component that is utilized across the website for various forms.

5. **Radio Group Component**:
   - A component used to select one option from a list, implemented in the registration process.

6. **Checkbox Component**:
   - Used to allow users to select multiple options, also incorporated in the registration process.

These components were integrated throughout different sections of the project. My work focused on making sure that these components were fully responsive and user-friendly.

## How to Run the Project

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repo-name.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd repo-name
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The application will run locally at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Conclusion

This project was an invaluable learning experience, allowing me to apply and enhance my skills in **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. I enjoyed working on both the individual components and seeing how they fit into the larger structure of the project.
